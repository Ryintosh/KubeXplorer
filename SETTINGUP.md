# Requirements

We will be utilizing kind to set up a local cluster to demonstrate how this application works.

Follow the directions from [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) or test in a development enviornment to see the changes this codebase will introduce.
Once you have the kubernetes cluster you want make sure you have the following:
- kubectl
- desired kubernetes objects

# Kubernetes Components

# Kubernetes Objects
